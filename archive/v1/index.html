	<h1>WHAT</h1>
	<p>This website servces two purposes:
		<ul>
			<li>Showcase my work</li>
			<li>Serve as a personal sandbox for web development</li>
		</ul></p>
	<p>The site will change periodically as I learn new things. I created it from scratch, starting with raw HTML and CSS as a way to sharpen my existing knowledge of basic web design. I plan to add other elements, platforms and languages as I go. If the site looks basic now, come back in a few months! I am currently learning and/or improving on (in order): UX/UI design & HTML, CSS and Bootstrap (where I am now); PHP; JavaScript; Angular.</p> 

	<p>I've been dabbling in HTML, CSS and WordPress for years, and am building a front-end portfolio on that. Read about my progress <a href="https://medium.com/@alexalexdmv" class="main" target=_"blank" rel="nopener">on my Medium page</a>.</p>
